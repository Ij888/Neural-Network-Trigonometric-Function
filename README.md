# Neural-Network-Trigonometric-Function
A brief example of a neural network approximating a function of a known relationship. In this case the sine function.


This repository contains four files. Firstly a random dataset generator, this is just for the purposes of showing where the training
and testing datasets came from. If you wish to try another function, such as a cosine function, simply change the line
```
y = math.sin(x)
```
to whatever you want in it's place.

**Dependecies**

To use this program you will need the follwing python packages:

Keras

Numpy

Matplotlib

**Usage**

To run this file simply open your command line and navigate to your directory and run

```
python Model.py
```

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate a neural networks ability to approximate functions, feel
Free to edit this code and have a play about!

**NOTE**

If you are wondering about the back end this example was built with tensorflow but will
Run with Theano as well!
